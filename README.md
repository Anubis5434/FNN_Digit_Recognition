# FNN_Digit_Recognition
An implementation of Neural Network on image recognition
# Description
The goal of is to label images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) by implementing a neural network from scratch. All of the functions needed to initialize, train, evaluate, and make predictions with the network were defined.
# Dataset
The MNIST dataset is comprised of 70,000 handwritten numerical digit images and their respective labels. There are 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, all of which are 28 pixels by 28 pixels.
# Detail
The provided lib.py implements neural network layers as different Modules with methods forward and backward to implement the forward computation process and the backpropagation gradient computation process. The structure of Module is inspired by the popular deep learning framework PyTorch.
